# What is This?
This is my script to autoconfigure my new Ubuntu Server virtual machines. it won't work for you, probably.

It is designed to be downloaded and ready as fast as  possible

# Usage
Use _wget_ or _curl_ to get the script:

```
wget -O sh.sh https://t.ly/DTWSr
```
then
```
sudo sh sh.sh
```

you can name the script however you like. i named it like that because is faster to type it



## Comments

I use [https://t.ly/github/url-shortener](url) to shorten links because it does not corrupt scripts unlike other link shorteners
